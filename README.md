# ChatGPT Chrome Extension:  Save ChatGPT Conversation to file

This is a simple Chrome extension that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate chat messages. It allows you to quickly save chat to file, making it a useful tool for sharing your experience with friends or colleagues.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the code from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode by clicking the toggle switch in the upper right corner.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you downloaded the code.

## Usage

To use the extension, click the extension icon in the top right corner of your browser window. This will open the extension popup, where you can save the chat as html that you can share. 

## About

This extension was created as a collaboration between myself and ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. The process of programming the extension with ChatGPT was both challenging and rewarding, and I learned a lot about working with AI language models and debugging code.

As a developer, I was skeptical of using chatGPT. However, I wanted to see how it would work in practice, so I decided to try it out. 

I decided to use ChatGPT to program a Chrome extension. The idea was to create an extension that would save a conversation in HTML format, so i can share it with my friends and colleagues. As part of the experiment, I tried to make as few changes to the code as possible and asked for assistance for debugging whenever possible. 

During our session, I explained my requirements to ChatGPT and asked for its assistance. It provided me with sample code and helped me debug my code by identifying errors and suggesting solutions. I was able to iterate on the code and improve it until I had a working solution.

One of the key benefits of working with ChatGPT was the ability to get quick answers to my questions. It was like having a programming expert on hand 24/7. I also appreciated the fact that ChatGPT could provide sample code and debug errors, which saved me a lot of time and effort. In writing this extension, I repeated the same chat a few times. A couple of interesting side effects, it seem to rewrite the code differently between the different sessions. And in some cases there were negative side-effects or bugs in the code. But with a bit of probing, it would understand the mistake and very graciously apologize "I apologize for my mistake in my previous response." and offer an alternatives solutions. 

In the end, I was able to create a Chrome extension that met my requirements. The extension could save a conversation in HTML format, making it easy to share and store conversations for future reference. The collaboration with ChatGPT was a valuable learning experience. I was able to overcome my initial skepticism of using a language model for programming and discovered how useful it can be in the right context.

Overall, programming a Chrome extension with ChatGPT was a collaborative and iterative process. I had to be patient, ask the right questions, and be open to feedback and suggestions. But in the end, the results were worth it. I would definitely consider using ChatGPT for future programming projects.
